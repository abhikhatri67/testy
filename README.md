A very simple JS testing library, for educational purposes. Live at npm at [@pmoo/testy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pmoo/testy).

## Installation

`npm install --save-dev @pmoo/testy`

**Supported Node versions**: 6.x or higher

## Usage

### Running a single file

```javascript
const { suite, test, assert } = require('@pmoo/testy');

suite('a boring test suite', () => {
  test('true is obviously true', () => assert.isTrue(true))
}).run();
```

(notice the `run()` at the end)

### Running tests from a folder

```javascript
const { Testy } = require('@pmoo/testy');

Testy.configuredWith({
  // relative or absolute path
  directory: './tests',
  // 'en' is the default. For example, you can try 'es' to see output in Spanish
  language: 'en',
  // Stops at the first failed or errored test. false by default
  failFast: false,
}).run();
```

And it will run every file under the `tests` directory, and you can define suites in those files.

In this case, make sure suites don't have the `run()` at the end, otherwise they are going to be executed twice.

### Examples and available assertions

* Boolean assertions:
  * `assert.that(boolean).isTrue()` or `assert.isTrue(boolean)`. It does a strict comparison against `true` (`object === true`)
  * `assert.that(boolean).isFalse()` or `assert.isFalse(boolean)`. It does a strict comparison against `false` (`object === false`)
* Equality assertions:
  * `assert.that(actual).isEqualTo(expected)` or `assert.areEqual(actual, expected)`.
  * `assert.that(actual).isNotEqualTo(expected)` or `assert.areNotEqual(actual, expected)`
  * Equality assertions use a deep object comparison (based on Node's `assert` module) and fail if objects under comparison have circular references.
  * Equality criteria on non-primitive objects can be specified:
    * Passing an extra two-arg comparator function to `isEqualTo(expected, criteria)` or `areEqual(actual, expected, criteria)`
    * Passing a method name that `actual` object understands: `isEqualTo(expected, 'myEqMessage')` or `areEqual(actual, expected, 'myEqMessage')`
    * By default, if `actual` has an `equals` method it will be used.  
* Exception testing:
  * `assert.that(() => { ... }).raises(error)` or with regex `.raises(/part of message/)`
  * `assert.that(() => { ... }).doesNotRaise(error)`
  * `assert.that(() => { ... }).doesNotRaiseAnyErrors()`
* Array inclusion:
  * `assert.that(collection).includes(object)`
  * `assert.that(collection).doesNotInclude(object)`
  * `assert.that(collection).includesExactly(...objects)`
* Emptiness
  * `assert.that(arrayOrString).isEmpty()`
  * `assert.that(arrayOrString).isNotEmpty()`

Please take a look at the `tests` folder, you'll find examples of each possible test you can write. Testy is self-tested.

### Other features

* **Support for pending tests**: if a test has no body, it will be reported as `[WIP]` and it won't be considered a failure.
* **Fail-Fast mode**: if enabled, it stops execution in the first test that fails (or has an error). Remaining tests will be marked as skipped.
* **Strict check for assertions**: if a test does not evaluate any assertion while it is executed, the result is considered an error. Basically, a test with no assertion is considered a "bad" test. 

## Why?

Why another testing library? The main reason is that we want to keep simplicity, something it's hard to see in the main testing tools out there.

* **Zero dependencies:** right now, this library does not depend on any npm package, making the library easy to install. This is also good for installing on places where the internet connection is not good and we don't want to download hundreds of libraries.
* **Understandable object-oriented code:** we want to use this tool for teaching, so eventually we'll look at the code during lessons, and students should be able to see what is going on, and even contributing at it, with no dark magic involved. Also, we try to follow good OO practices.
* **Unique set of features:** we are not following any specification nor trying to copy behavior from other approaches (like the "xUnit" or "xSpec" way).
